# Kuchipudi-Hastas-Detector

An AI-powered Streamlit application designed to assist Kuchipudi dancers in learning and understanding the **Hastas** (hand gestures) used in this classical Indian dance form. The app takes a hand gesture as input and returns its **name**, **meaning**, and **explanation**. It is especially helpful for learners who struggle with memorizing the names, slokas, meanings, and the visual representations of these gestures.

##  Project Highlights

-  Detects **single-hand (Asamyukta Hastas)** and **double-hand (Samyukta Hastas)** gestures.
-  Provides **meanings and context** for each hasta.
-  Built with **Python 3.13** and **Streamlit** for a smooth and intuitive UI.
-  Designed to be extended with datasets and models â€” no dataset included in this repo.
-  No use of OpenCV or complex dependencies â€” clean and focused on logic and UI.

## ðŸ“¸ Dataset Information

This repository **does not include a dataset**. You must use or collect a dataset that contains images of **Kuchipudi hand gestures** in various forms (clear, front-facing, and correctly labeled). Ideally, the dataset should have:

- High-resolution images
- Labeled gestures for both hands
- Balanced examples of all Hastas

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

The app uses a classification model to detect a given hand gesture from an uploaded image (once integrated with a dataset). It identifies the gesture and displays:

- The name of the gesture (in Sanskrit/English)
- Its classification (Asamyukta or Samyukta)
- The traditional sloka (if available)
- The symbolic meaning or usage in dance
